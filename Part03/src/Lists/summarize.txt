Each list is its own separate entity, and the list methods always concern the list that was used to call the method. A summary of some list methods is provided below. It's assumed that the created list contains variables of type string.

Adding to a list is done with the method add that receives the value to be added as a parameter.
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("hello world!");

The number of elements in a list can be discovered with the non-parameterized method size; it returns an integer.
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
int size = list.size();
System.out.println(size);

You can retrieve a value from a certain index with the method get that is given the index at which the value resides as a parameter.
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("hello world!");
String string = list.get(0);
System.out.println(string);

Removing elements from a list is done with the help of remove. It receives as a parameter either the value that is to be removed, or the index of the value to be removed.
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
// remove the string "hello world!"
list.remove("hello world!");
 // remove the value at index 3
list.remove(3);

Checking for the existence of a value is done with the method contains. It's provided the value being searched for as a parameter, and it returns a boolean value.
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
boolean found = list.contains("hello world!");
